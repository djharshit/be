# Temporary Backend Project

## Description
This backend application, built using Python and Flask, receives form data from a frontend application and prints it to the console (sys.stdout).

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- Flask library installed (you can install it using `pip install flask`)

## Usage
1. Install the libraries.
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
3. Run the Python script `app.py` to start the backend server.
   ```python app.py```
4. The server will be running on http://localhost:5000. Ensure it's up and running.
5. Submit form data from the frontend to this server, and the server will print the received data to the console.

## Implementation Details
The backend is implemented using Python and Flask.
It includes a single route that listens for POST requests and prints the received data to sys.stdout.
